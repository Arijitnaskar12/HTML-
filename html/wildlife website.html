        Many Indian species are descendants of species originating in Gondwana, of which 
        India originally was a part. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, 
        the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic change 
        20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[5] Soon thereafter, mammals e
        ntered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either side of the emerging Himalaya.
        [6] As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of 
        reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians[1] Notable endemics are the Nilgiri langur and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of
         the Western Ghats. India harbours 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species.[7] India is located at the junction
          of three realms namely Afrotropical, Indomalayan and Paleoarctic, and therefore, has characteristic elements from each of 
          them, spurring migration of avifauna from these regions.
